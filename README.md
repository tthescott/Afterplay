# Afterplay

### Description
Do you like when songs have seamless transitions between them? I do. I like them so much that I find myself opening Spotify just to queue the next song so I can hear the transition. I hate doing this and I think you do too. **With Afterplay, you can link two songs together, and when the first song plays, the linked song will automatically be added to the queue.**

I've set this up to only work when shuffle is off, as I assume if your shuffle is off you don't want your queue disturbed (like if you're listening to an album front to back). Also, it only queues the song if your user-added queue is empty, as I assume you don't want that queue disturbed (also the linked song would be added at the end of the queue - not very helpful).

### Usage
Not hosted or functional yet. Planned to work only with Spotify, lmk if you want support for another streaming service.
