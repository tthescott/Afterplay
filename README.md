## Description
Do you like when songs have seamless transitions between them? I do. I like them so much that I find myself opening Spotify just to queue the next song so I can hear the transition. I hate doing this and I think you do too. **With Afterplay, you can link two songs together, and when the first song plays, the linked song will automatically be added to the queue.**

I've set this up to only work when shuffle is on, as I assume if shuffle is off you don't want your queue disturbed (like if you're listening to an album front to back). Also, it only queues the song if your user-added queue is empty, as I assume you don't want that queue disturbed (also the linked song would be added at the end of the queue - not very helpful).
